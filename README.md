# Network Rerouting Simulator for Sustainable Networks (Final Year Project - Bachelor in Computer Science)

* A network simulator to observe connections between devices on a dashboard
* A user can choose number of devices
* A user can choose type of topology
* A user can change each connection weightage
* A user can select a starting and ending point to see data moves through which path when theres more than one
* A dijkstra algorithm is use to calculate the best path based on the weightage and number of hops
* A user can purposely destroy current best path to find an alternative
* A user can preplan his network of devices with the help of this tool

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* ASP.net for windows application project
* C# as the language
* SQL as the database
